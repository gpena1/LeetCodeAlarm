# Hello there!
The intention behind this simple alarm is as suggested by the repository name: to alert you that the LeetCode daily problem has dropped! Here are some instructions for use:
1. Clone the repository. Take note of where you clone it, as this will be needed in the shell scripts' and alarm program's `PATH_TO_REPO` variables. I have found that using the absolute path is best to avoid any issues.
2. Add `0 20 * * * PATH_TO_REPO/runproject.sh` to your crontab, where `PATH_TO_REPO` is as it is defined in step 1. This schedules the script to run at 8 PM on your time, which is when the daily problem drops in UTC-4, so be sure to adjust the second number (the hour) as is necessary for this to be accurate for you.
3. Wait for the problem to drop! Any issues the project has running should be logged in your directory's `cron.log` file, so be sure to check there if you encounter any issues.
